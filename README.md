Module 1: Fundamentals & Basic Programming

This module covers the initial setup of a Java development environment and the fundamentals of Java programming. The objective is to write, compile, and run basic programs while understanding primitive data types, variables, and operators.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Program: HelloWorld

üìñ Description
This is the first Java program that demonstrates the basic structure of a Java application. It prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console.

This program helps beginners understand how to:

  main() method execution
  
  Console output in Java

2Ô∏è‚É£ Program: DataTypesDemo

üìñ Description
This program, created in the JavaBasics project, demonstrates the usage of all primitive data types in Java.
It declares variables of each type, assigns values to them, and prints their values on the console.
This program helps in understanding how different data types work and their ranges.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Concepts
